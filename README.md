# C23-PS117 Machine Learning
Proudly presented by Capstone Team
## Documentation:
- We got the dataset from kaggle and it was from 3 different author
- We split the dataset that we got into training, dev(validation), and test data
- For dev and test data each has 150 files, the training data has 700 file, in total we have 1000 files for each class
- We save each class name that we have into labels.txt
- We train the model using transfer learning with MobileNet feature extractor
- We evaluate the modelÂ performance
